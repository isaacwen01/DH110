# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing

Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021

### Introduction:
Like its name suggests, the County of Hawai’i website is a multi-purpose website for the county of Hawaii, hosting information on tax payments, parks & recreation, employment, vehicle registration, and more. For my case study, I will be primarily focusing on the Department of Vehicle Licensing. Under the Vehicle Registration and Licensing department, users can make appointments for VRL office visits and road tests, as well as find out information about the different types of licenses offered in Hawaii.

### Purpose of Usability Testing:
The purpose of a usability test (UT) is to evaluate a website using the three metrics of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. It is a relatively reliable way to identify and gauge how severe specific usability problems are. By giving participants tasks and observing their behavior and thoughts as they work through them, UT allows designers to better empathize with a typical user of the product. Frustrations of the user are highlighted and are used to point out areas of improvement for the next iteration of design.

### Methodology
Because the participant’s facial expressions should be observed, the pilot UT will take place in a quiet dorm room where masks are not mandated. The moderator and participant will sit adjacent to each other, with the camera centered on the participant. The test will be done on a laptop simultaneously displaying the website on the left side and the survey form on the right. The screen, along with footage of the participant and moderator, will be recorded via zoom. 

| Heuristic | Usability Problem | Task Scenario |
|---|---|---|
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors | When choosing a date for a Road Test Appointment, the user is not notified when the next available date and time is. | Find the earliest date for a road test appointment. |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | The lack of paragraph breaks throughout the information-dense pages makes finding certain requirements/documents difficult. | Identify the documents and procedures necessary to renew a license. |
| Help and Documentation | The FAQ section for the Department of Vehicle Registration & Licensing is obscured and not discoverable through the search function. | Find the FAQ section and check if a fax copy of an insurance card will suffice for a VRL office visit. |

The process of the UT is as follows:
1. The moderator will introduce the study as well as the UT process to the participant.
2. The participant will fill out the informed consent form and the pre-test questionnaire that measures first impressions of the County of Hawai’i website.
3. The participants will complete 3 tasks, walking the moderator through their thought process.
4. Once finished, the participant will answer post-test questions measuring the perceived difficulty, efficiency, and satisfaction of each task.
5. The participant will answer System Usability Scale to rate their overall experience with the website.
6. Subsequently, the participant will choose five adjectives that best describe their experience with the website.
7. The participant will be given a few minutes to explore the website on their own before providing demographic information.

### Reflection
For a pilot test, this usability test went pretty well. The participant was very cooperative and pretty familiar with similar testing/interview scenarios. He verbalized his thought process very clearly, articulating what he struggled with the most, and even suggested improvements that could streamline the user journey for each task. As the moderator, I didn’t have to give too many hints or speak much at all aside from reading the script, so I do not think my explanations affected the participant’s overall experience too much. 

In regards to the County of Hawai’i website, the participant reaffirmed the usability problems I initially noticed through the heuristic evaluation.  For instance, the participant was not able to complete the first task, as all the dates and locations he checked for a road test appointment were fully booked. There was no system that suggested the next available date for the user. On the other hand, for the second and third tasks, the participant was able to complete them, though they took a longer time than I had anticipated.

In terms of areas of improvement, I think I should redesign my tasks so that each one only tests one heuristic. I realized the first task was essentially testing both the website’s ability to help users recognize, diagnose, recover from errors as well as its adherence to consistency and standards––this was not my intention. Specifically, the participant felt frustrated about finding the link to make a road test appointment, and this could be attributed to the lack of buttons on the page (consistency and standard problem). To get more conclusive insights, I should revise each task scenario so that only one heuristic is being tested.

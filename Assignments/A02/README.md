# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing

Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021

### Introduction:
Like its name suggests, the County of Hawai’i website is a multi-purpose website for the county of Hawaii, hosting information on tax payments, parks & recreation, employment, vehicle registration, and more. For my case study, I will be primarily focusing on the Department of Vehicle Licensing. Under the Vehicle Registration and Licensing department, users can make appointments for VRL office visits and road tests, as well as find out information about the different types of licenses offered in Hawaii.

### Purpose of Usability Testing:
The purpose of a usability test (UT) is to evaluate a website using the three metrics of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. It is a relatively reliable way to identify and gauge how severe specific usability problems are. By giving participants tasks and observing their behavior and thoughts as they work through them, UT allows designers to better empathize with a typical user of the product. Frustrations of the user are highlighted and are used to point out areas of improvement for the next iteration of design.

### Methodology
Because the participant’s facial expressions should be observed, the pilot UT will take place in a quiet dorm room where masks are not mandated. The moderator and participant will sit adjacent to each other, with the camera centered on the participant. The test will be done on a laptop simultaneously displaying the website on the left side and the survey form on the right. The screen, along with footage of the participant and moderator, will be recorded via zoom. 

| Heuristic | Usability Problem | Task Scenario |
|---|---|---|
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors | When choosing a date for a Road Test Appointment, the user is not notified when the next available date and time is. | Find the earliest date for a road test appointment. |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | The lack of paragraph breaks throughout the information-dense pages makes finding certain requirements/documents difficult. | Identify the documents and procedures necessary to renew a license. |
| Help and Documentation | The FAQ section for the Department of Vehicle Registration & Licensing is obscured and not discoverable through the search function. | Find the FAQ section and check if a fax copy of an insurance card will suffice for a VRL office visit. |

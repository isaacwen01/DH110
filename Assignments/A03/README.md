# DH150 Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry

### Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021


## Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?  
* This project will support users in applying for an instructional permit and/or driver’s license in Hawaii, as well as other activities where they have to interact with the Vehicle Registration & Licensing Department.

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
* This activity fulfills the user’s transportation needs because acquiring a license would allow them to reach places of work, education, recreation, or places that satisfy their other needs (such as groceries, police department, etc.) more conveniently. By driving, users will be able to cut down on their commuting time while enjoying the freedom of having control over where they go, arrive, and leave.

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
* The traditional solution to apply for a permit or license is to fill out a written application and bring it to the local DMV, along with other legally required documents. Current solutions allow the user to make an appointment online to expedite the process. To acquire a permit, the user must also pass a written test. To acquire a license, the user must have possessed a permit for a certain period of time depending on their age and pass a road test.


#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
* Understanding the process: for first-time applicants, the multiple stages of the application process, along with the long list of requirements, may feel foreign. It is extremely easy for them to forget a legal document or to fulfill a requirement if they do not read carefully.
* Understanding the language: the application form as well, as the legal documents required, uses a lot of jargon that first-time permit/license applicants might not understand
* Long wait time: the permit/license application process is infamously long and inefficient. Quite often, applicants have to wait past their appointment time before reaching the front desk to submit their application form


## Step 2: Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?
* Demographics: students (mainly in high school and college) who want to start driving, senior citizens who have to renew their licenses
* Preferences: users who have the desire to drive and thus need to require a permit or license to do so.
* Expertise: users would not need any particular level of expertise for this project

#### Where would the users do that activity?
* To apply for a permit or license, users would have to make an appointment either online or via phone call, fill out the required application form either online (digital or printed) or physically form from the DMV, and gather their legal documents from home. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
* The goal of the users would be to make an appointment online for a written test (permit) or road test (license). To do that, they would have to go to the County of Hawaii’s website, choose to make an appointment, specify the reason of appointment, fill out their personal information, indicate which legal documents they will bring, and finally select an open slot. 


## Step 3: Pick Research Methods

#### Methods
* To get a better understanding of how I can improve the user experience of the website for my target audience, I conducted a contextual inquiry interview.
* The session consisted of the following:

 **1.	Background questions**
    a.  I wanted to learn more about my target user’s thoughts on applying for a driver’s permit or license: their apprehensions, their overall impression of the process, their motivation for applying, their desire to apply, and so on.
  
 **2.	Observation**
    a.	I allowed the user to book an appointment for a written test (permit) and a road test (license), asking that they verbalized their thoughts as they moved through the task.
  b.	After the user successfully or unsuccessfully completed the objective, I asked follow-up questions to gauge their thoughts on the difficulty of the task and the efficiency of the website.
  
 **3.	Follow-up questions**
    a.	Afterwards, I asked the user some directive questions about what specific aspects they found difficult about each task, how the problems they encountered might affect other uses, and their overal feelings on the process of applying for a permit or license.



## Step 4: Observation/Interview Guide

* Here is the link to the [interview script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q5xQgoCcj9-_8CHr-Bs_nBvVZ9nejpKN9JFdvcb2EOk/edit?usp=sharing)


## Step 5: Conducting the Research

* Here is the link to the [transcription of the whole interview and participatory observation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E2CohPc6rUwAMgB54cY0xZ3uaaPV3j8Fy878ju3Bi7w/edit?usp=sharing)
* Here is the link to the recording of the [contexual inquiry interview:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1utbi2oDatdWyiCnw3sUwT7KS6vRC4YbY/view?usp=sharing)

* Some interesting insights from the interview:
  * *The availability of DMV appointments affects people’s desire to apply for a permit/license*
  
    > "I think [the availability of DMV appointments], that affects my desire to apply quite a bit. Actually, there was a week in the summer where I was like, ‘I am going to go to a DMV at like, eight o'clock or something in the morning’. So I can like, or like seven o'clock in the morning, so I can, like, go before I have to go to work. But then, I was just thinking about the long lines. And so I was like, I have to go really early. But then something kept happening in the morning where I just kept, kept getting like pushed back. And then eventually I just gave up and I was like, you know, I just don't have time. And I was just very stressed. "
    
    To this user, the long lines at the DMV discouraged her from applying for a permit because she would have to wake up extra early to arrive before the crowd comes in. This is extremely inconvenient because she would have to spend extra time while losing out on sleep. It seems like the user values her time and would likely prioritize other responsibilities over going to the DMV.

    
  * *Jargon confuses potential applicants*
  
    > "I think I would just, I would like there to be a little bit less text on the page and kind of like, like when that when it kind of gives you all that general information about the process, like I wish there was like one section that's kind of, like had everything just spelled out super clearly. And then links to all the pages that you need, like on this one page. Just super, just super clear that like, this is the main information that you need to see."
    
    The user was confused by the language used by the website as a lot of the kewords and links sounded similar; specifically, there were multiple types of permits and licenses that she could apply to. A first-time applicant might have a hard time differentiating between these different types.
   
  * *Overal unfamiliarity with the process of getting a license*
  
    > "I think I would just, I would like there to be a little bit less text on the page and kind of like, like when that when it kind of gives you all that general information about the process, like I wish there was like one section that's kind of, like had everything just spelled out super clearly. And then links to all the pages that you need, like on this one page. Just super, just super clear that like, this is the main information that you need to see. ."
    
    The user seems to be unfamiliar with the process of applying, so to her, the website had too much information in a very unorganized way that was hard to navigate. The website lacks an overview of the entire process, which might upset or frustrate first-time applicants.


## Step 6: Reflection

* Overall, I felt that the contextual inquiry interview went pretty well. While designing my interview questions, I was afraid that the questions I created were too vague; I also struggled with coming up with background questions tailored towards my target user, a person without a driver’s permit or license. I felt that there weren’t a lot of quantitative questions I could ask them, considering driving behavior wasn’t applicable.
* However, after conducting the interview, I felt that the answers my test user gave were actually extremely helpful in pinpointing the pain points of the audience. By observing how she interacted with the website, I got a better understanding of *how* my target user would interact with the product, *what* they would feel as they navigated the site, and *why* they felt that way. Specifically, the test user’s input reaffirmed my concerns regarding the website having too much information, lacking visual cues (like buttons), and having no system that prevents or checks for errors.
* That being said, I do think I helped the user a little too much during the observation portion of the contextual inquiry. I saw that she was getting quite frustrated when trying to find information about applying for a permit and wanted to nudge her towards the right direction. To uphold the accuracy of my interview insights, I should have waited until the user requested for help and observed how she would have resolved that obstacle on her own.

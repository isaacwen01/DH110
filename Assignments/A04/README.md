# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry
Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021

## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
* UX storytelling is the key to empathizing and understanding the user. Storytelling essentially places the designer in the user’s shoes, 
  allowing them to imagine problems the user faces and visualize how the user may respond to them. 
* This allows them to design product features that more directly resolve the pain points of the user.
* Most importantly, UX storytelling helps the designer get rid of any biases they might have had and design in a human-centered manner.

## Proposed Features
Based on my initial heuristic evaluation of the website and the series of user interviews I conducted, I proposed the following features
that would be able to tackle the target user's pain points:
* **Interactive Timeline**
* **Help Button**


## Scenarios & Journey Map

### 1. Mia's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Mia is using this product
> Mia is a 16-year old high school junior who has been looking forward to getting a driver’s license for a long time. After her 16th birthday, her parents finally gave her permission to drive. She is beyond excited but is completely clueless about the prerequisites of getting a license. She wants to start as soon as possible but needs someone to walk her through the process so she has some expectations. Having an impatient temperament, Mia wants to know how long she has to wait for each “step” of the process so she doesn’t waste too much time. 
> Growing up in the digital age, Mia is very comfortable with technology and has a tendency to move through web pages quickly. She goes to the County of Hawai’i website and is able to locate the Vehicle Registration & Licensing Division relatively easily. Initially confused by the unfamiliar terms used by the site, such as “CDL permits,” Mia feels a little intimidated as she skims through some of the notifications about policy changes or updates. However, she scrolls down to find an interactive timeline that gives a high-level overview of the application process and breaks it down into digestible steps. Each step indicates its estimated wait time or processing time, which Mia finds very practical for a busy high schooler like herself. Mia clicks the “learn more” button under each step to learn more about the parts of the application process in more detail. Now having some expectations of what the process will look like, Mia cheers up and begins filling out the application form.

### 2. Nicole's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Nicole is using this product
> Nicole just moved to Irvine from New York after getting married. She really misses her four best friends from back in New York. They used to have a book club where every month, they read one book and meet at her apartment to talk about it over dinner. Nicole and her friends still want to have an “online book club,” where they can discuss books and recommend new books to each other. She also wants to be able to track and organize all of the books she’s read by herself and with her friends.

#### How Nicole is using this product
> After dinner, Nicole opens the app to see that her friend Lisa posted a comment about a book she and her friends are reading together. She responds to the comment by clicking the “reply” button under Lisa’s comment. Nicole also found a new book she wants to read with them, so she types in the title of the book in the search bar, then clicks “share,” and shares them to her friends.

### 3. David's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why David is using this product
> David is a retired English teacher living in Seattle with his wife. He wants to talk and interact with his grandchildren, who are ages 10 and 14 and live in San Francisco. He decides that recommending books would be a good way to connect with them, since he knows about many good classic novels. Because he reads many books at the same time, he also wants to keep track of his thoughts on a book, so that he can immediately remember where he left off in the story. However, David only needs these two features, so he really wants something that is simple to use.

#### How David is using this product
> Since his older grandchild asked if he knows any historical fiction novels, David decides to share with him All Quiet on the Western Front. He searches the title in the search bar, then finds the book as the first result. He clicks on it, and then clicks the “share” button. The shared book goes to the private group he has with his grandchildren on the application. Then, he goes back to the home screen, where he clicks on the “notes” section, because he wants to read a book he has not touched in a few weeks. He jogs his memory by reading his notes, and starts reading the book.

## Reflection
* Coming up with personas was more difficult than I expected. Thinking of unbiased, diverse personas while taking everything from the heuristic evaluations and user interviews into account made me really feel like I knew these users personally. 
* Next time, I would also like to take research about more demographic information, such as the main population group that
reads books or uses reading apps, to make decisions about personas.

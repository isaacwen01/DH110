# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry
Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021

## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
* UX storytelling is the key to empathizing and understanding the user. Storytelling essentially places the designer in the user’s shoes, 
  allowing them to imagine problems the user faces and visualize how the user may respond to them. 
* This allows them to design product features that more directly resolve the pain points of the user.
* Most importantly, UX storytelling helps the designer get rid of any biases they might have had and design in a human-centered manner.

## Proposed Features
Based on my initial heuristic evaluation of the website and the series of user interviews I conducted, I proposed the following features
that would be able to tackle the target user's pain points:
* **Interactive Timeline**
* **Help Button**


## Scenarios & Journey Map

### 1. Mia's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Mia is using this product
> Mia is a 16-year old high school junior who has been looking forward to getting a driver’s license for a long time. After her 16th birthday, her parents finally gave her permission to drive. She is beyond excited but is completely clueless about the prerequisites of getting a license. She wants to start as soon as possible but needs someone to walk her through the process so she has some expectations. Having an impatient temperament, Mia wants to know how long she has to wait for each “step” of the process so she doesn’t waste too much time. 

#### How Mia is using this product
> Growing up in the digital age, Mia is very comfortable with technology and has a tendency to move through web pages quickly. She goes to the County of Hawai’i website and is able to locate the Vehicle Registration & Licensing Division relatively easily. Initially confused by the unfamiliar terms used by the site, such as “CDL permits,” Mia feels a little intimidated as she skims through some of the notifications about policy changes or updates. However, she scrolls down to find an interactive timeline that gives a high-level overview of the application process and breaks it down into digestible steps. Each step indicates its estimated wait time or processing time, which Mia finds very practical for a busy high schooler like herself. Mia clicks the “learn more” button under each step to learn more about the parts of the application process in more detail. Now having some expectations of what the process will look like, Mia cheers up and begins filling out the application form.

### 2. Frida's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Frida is using this product
> Frida is a 78-year old retired senior who is a grandmother to several grandchildren. One of her children has recently started a new yet highly demanding job, so Frida wants to help out by taking care of her 7-year old grandchild and taking him to his extracurricular classes. Previously relying on public transportation, Frida must renew her license and re-familiarize herself with driving in order to be able to take her grandson to his daily karate classes and weekly piano lessons. However, she is unfamiliar with the license renewal process, especially now that it is highly digitized. As a senior, Frida isn’t very proficient at using laptops and smartphones and prefers more traditional methods of communication. She needs much assistance with navigating the site and is apprehensive about being on the road again after not driving for many years.

#### How Frida is using this product
> Barely able to reach the County of Hawai’i website, Frida is unable to navigate to the “License Renewal” page. She repeatedly clicks the back and forwards button on the browser, thinking it would help her move towards her desired destination. Though frustrated, Frida notices a help button with a question mark icon at the bottom right corner of the screen. She clicks it and a popup appears asking if she needs help. Frida clicks “yes” and is taken to a help webpage specifically for the Vehicle Registration & Licensing Division, which also includes a FAQ section. Frida finds a helpline number, calls it, and is promptly connected to a representative who walks her through the application process verbally and emails her the necessary forms. After the call, Frida browses through the FAW section to find a senior citizen module with practical advice from other seniors who have successfully renewed their licenses. Feeling relieved, Frida begins to fill out the license renewal application form.

## Reflection
* It was actually really fun creating the prototype personas and giving them realistic backstories to bring them to life. For Mia's persona, I based it off of my second test user, but ultimatley gave her a different personality and upbringing. However, she still shares the same primary struggles as those indicated by my test user during the contextual inquiry. I had to get a little creative with the second persona, and decided to focus in on the other end of the age spectrum––seniors who understandably have a lot of trouble adjusting to the digitization of once handwritten, traditional application forms.
* The biggest difficulty of this assignment was translating the "challenges" for each persona to their respective journey maps. I found that each challenge the 
personas faced were solved by different features. Since the scenarios are centered around the product features, I had to narrow down the challenges I chose to address in each journey map.

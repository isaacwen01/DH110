# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype
Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021

## The Purpose of Low-fidelity Prototyping
Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototyping is a quick and relatively easy way for designers to test the layout, information hierarchy, and functionality 
of proposed features of a work-in-progress product at a relatively low cost. Its purpose is to “fail quickly”––to identify problems early on in 
the design process and help designers rapidly redesign the product. 

For my project, lo-fi prototyping allows me to realize whether or not my redesign of the original website was effective


## User Research
Based on my user research and contextual inquiry, I identified three major problems with the current County of Hawaii website, specifically regarding the pages related to the Vehicle Registration & Licensing Division:
1. First-time permit/license applicants find it difficult to sift through the vast amount of information and understand the language used on the website.
2. There is no error-prevention method when booking appointments.
3. There is no FAQ or help section specifically for the Vehicle Registration & Licensing Division.


## User Personas
From my initial research, I created two user personas that would best represent my target audience
1. Mia Reyes: a 16 year-old high school student who is eager to get her license as soon as possible.
> Scenario: Mia is unfamiliar with the process of acquiring a license and needs a high-level overview of the procedures.
2. Frida Tachibana: a 78 year-old grandmother who wants to renew her license to help take care of her grandchildren.
> Scenario: Frida is not technologically literate and requires additional assistance navigating the online application to renew her license.


## Tasks/Features
1. Use the Interactive Timeline
2. Make an appointment (Instruction Permit)
3. Access visual & audio guide (License Renewal)*

&ast; This feature was modified from assignment 4 per the professor’s suggestions

## Wireflow
### Flow 1
This wireflow was designed to test tasks 1 & 2.

### Flow 2
This wireflow was designed to test task 3. This was kept separate from the main flow to avoid clutter.

### Confusions and/or unexpected interactions:
* On the “Permit & License General Information” screen, the user was not sure what to press (the icon or text) to view the interactive timeline.
* On the interactive timeline, the user overlooked the “read more” button and was not able to make the connection between the timeline with the subsequent pages that contain more detail about each stage of the process.
* While booking an appointment, the user was confused by the organization of information and the language used. 
  - On the first page, the different appointments are sorted by “Driver’s License”, “State ID”, and “Motor Vehicle Registration.” The user thought “Driver’s License” referred to the road test and not a way of categorizing appointments. 
  - After filling out his personal information, the user is presented with a screen with the title “Instruction Permit.” The user thought this was a mistake as he believed it brought him to a previous page; however, the “Instruction Permit” was simply the section of the appointment-scheduling form that asked for information about which type of instruction permit he is applying for.

### Confusions and/or unexpected interactions:
* The user mistakenly thought the “help” button at the bottom right corner was a help page specific to scheduling an appointment and not a visual & audio guide for “License Renewal” in general.


## Reflection
The process of creating a lo-fi prototype actually took much longer than I expected. I thought it would resemble more of a brainstorming activity, but I realized there was so much to consider when designing the layout of a mobile web page. Specifically, I struggled a lot to condense the vast amount of information on the original website, as there are a lot of policy changes, procedures, documents, associated with applying for or renewing a driver’s license. These components also vary depending on the type of license or DMV activity the user is interested in.

In terms of the process of creating the wireframes, I heavily referenced the original website on my phone to see what I liked and didn’t like. I tried grouping information into overarching categories that could be accessed via buttons and hid a lot of information that I thought might be intimidating or burdensome for the user to see. This was also my general approach to implementing the features I proposed for the previous assignment: organize them into high-level overviews with smaller buttons that would then show more detail.

After testing my lo-fi prototype, I quickly realized that many changes were necessary. First, I need to differentiate between clickable and non-clickable items on a page. Clickable items should be buttons or in a different color. Secondly, I should label the individual detailed pages that are linked to the interactive timeline with step numbers so the user can see where each one belongs in the timeline. In terms of the appointment-scheduling screens, I should revise the field titles from ambiguous titles like “Driver’s License” to more direct and accessible language like “Type of appointment”. Some screens of the appointment-scheduling sequence could also be eliminated to avoid confusion. Lastly, more specific screen titles or a progress bar would be helpful for the user to locate how far into the appointment-scheduling process they are.

I learned a lot from this assignment, but I think my main takeaway after hours of overthinking is this: lo-fi prototypes are meant to fail in some way! Instead of refining it to perfection, leave the components you’re unsure of for someone to test for you. This way, you can get rapid feedback on what works and what doesn’t work for your design.

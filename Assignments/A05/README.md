# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype
Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021

## The Purpose of Low-fidelity Prototyping
Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototyping is a quick and relatively easy way for designers to test the layout, information hierarchy, and functionality 
of proposed features of a work-in-progress product at a relatively low cost. Its purpose is to “fail quickly”––to identify problems early on in 
the design process and help designers rapidly redesign the product. 

For my project, lo-fi prototyping allows me to realize whether or not my redesign of the original website was effective


## User Research
Based on my user research and contextual inquiry, I identified three major problems with the current County of Hawaii website, specifically regarding the pages related to the Vehicle Registration & Licensing Division:
1. First-time permit/license applicants find it difficult to sift through the vast amount of information and understand the language used on the website.
2. There is no error-prevention method when booking appointments.
3. There is no FAQ or help section specifically for the Vehicle Registration & Licensing Division.


## User Personas
From my initial research, I created two user personas that would best represent my target audience
1. Mia Reyes: a 16 year-old high school student who is eager to get her license as soon as possible.
> Scenario: Mia is unfamiliar with the process of acquiring a license and needs a high-level overview of the procedures.
2. Frida Tachibana: a 78 year-old grandmother who wants to renew her license to help take care of her grandchildren.
> Scenario: Frida is not technologically literate and requires additional assistance navigating the online application to renew her license.


## Tasks/Features
1. Use the Interactive Timeline
2. Make an appointment (Instruction Permit)
3. Access visual & audio guide (License Renewal)*

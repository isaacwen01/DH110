# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 6: Interface Design
Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021

## Description 
The goal of the project is to redesign the current website for the Vehicle Registration & Licensing Department of the County of Hawai’i to make it more 
accessible and easier to use for its most common users: young first-time drivers and the elderly attempting to renew their license. Though applying 
for/renewing a license is a long and complicated process, the current website is overloaded with information and is hard to navigate, especially for a 
user who is unfamiliar with driving and/or legal terminology. Good interface design will categorize the website’s current information into more digestible 
chunks that will give the user a high-level overview of the process. It also hides less relevant information and visually guides the user to follow a certain 
path that will allow them to easily apply for/renew a permit or license.

## Impression Test:
Here is the link to the first round of [impression testing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1COGA-PxMYzvWXI-rnx4LyJaLv1ZeNWFl/view?usp=sharing). For this round of testing, I gave the user 5 seconds to look at the first screen and asked him his general impression of the site as well as what he thought the function of the site was. Then, I showed him the screen variations and asked him to compare it to the first screen, pointing out things he liked or disliked about each variation.


### Findings:
* Overall Impression: The user could immediately identify what the purpose of the website was. He could also immediately tell that it was a government-related 
website based on the interface design.
* Typography: The user preferred fonts that were easier to look at and not too dramatic. He did not like the second variation with all the letters capitalized, 
describing it as too “in your face” and overly strong.
* Shape: The user immediately indicated his dislike for the second variation, stating that the semi-rounded buttons were not a good look as it was halfway in 
between squared and rounded corners for no good reason. The user stated that the rectangular buttons (1st var) help establish the tone of a government website while the rounded buttons (3rd var) were more aesthetically pleasing.
* Color: The user preferred the light mode design over the dark mode. He stated that he was more used to using light mode, especially when it comes to reading 
information-heavy sites. He also pointed out that the color scheme for light mode was more compatible; the light blue background complimented the bright blue buttons well. In contrast, he felt that the dark color in the dark mode design did not match the vibrancy of the buttons and in exchange, created a stark, but awkward contrast.


## Revisions:
For the second round of [impression testing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VljcbC9BH3jJb7O5YwNYknC8lDRqzgoW/view?usp=sharing), I made 5 variations of the screen he liked the most from the previous impression test and asked him to compare and contrast each version.

### Findings:
* 1st var: This design remained unchanged from the previous test.
* 2nd var: The user did not appreciate the stylized button as it added no function or aesthetic value to the site.
* 3rd var: The user liked the design but said it was incomparable to the first variation.
* 4th var: The user appreciated the addition of the icons, but expressed that he still preferred the first variation because of its simplicity.
* 5th var: The user preferred this modification over the 4th because the rounded edges matched well with the icons and generated a more comfortable and “design”-like feel.


## Final Design:
In the end, I decided to use the 5th variation from the revised screens. I slightly modified the design by adding a rounded search bar to establish a more coherent identity throughout the page. The reason why I chose this 5th variation is that I thought the addition of icons would make it more accessible to users who may not be too fluent in English or struggle with English. In addition, I decided to round the edges of buttons, even if it makes the screen look less professional or government-like, to help make the interface appear less intimidating. The process of applying for or renewing a license is intimidating enough––the website that is supposed to show people *how* to do so does not need to be that serious-looking! I want the user to feel comfortable and encouraged to continue reading more about the process of getting/renewing a license without feeling stressed.

## Design Decisions:
**Typeface:**
> I chose Europa because I wanted to use a Sans Serif font for its modern feel and readability. Europa stood out to me among other Sans Serif fonts because it matched well with the logo font of the county of Hawai’i, so using it throughout the site did not seem unusual. The site will have a lot of information, so I wanted to keep the default body text size as 16. From there, I wanted the heading and subheading sizes to be somewhat similar and not too overpowerful, so I used 32 and 24 respectively.

**Color Scheme:** 
> I extracted most of these colors from the current County of Hawai’i website. I wanted the announcement bar containing COVID-19 information to be red to easily draw the attention of the user. I chose to use a more vibrant blue for the button colors so that the user would be more likely to click them, enhancing the call-to-action of each page. I deliberately set the background color to a lighter blue color close to white to maintain an analogous color scheme. The text colors I chose are all meant to be high-contrast in relation to its background––a darker blue when the text is placed directly on the background and white when the text is placed on the blue button.

**Layout Grid:**
> I chose to use 4 columns as it is pretty standard for mobile designs to have such a layout. On the other hand, I customized the rows a little more. Even though this page/wireframe only has buttons and not a lot of text, I wanted to have a lot of rows and small gutters in case I ever had to add paragraphs of texts. The multitude of rows gave me the flexibility to have more detailed arrangements without having to worry about components crossing the gutter and violating the gestalt principles.

# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 08: Pitch
Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021


### Introduction: 
This project aims to redesign the current website for the Vehicle Registration & Licensing (VRL) deparment of the County of Hawai'i to enhance its efficiency and improve its accessibility. The Vehicle Registration & Licensing Department has a notorious reputation of being highly ineffective and a hassle to work with, resulting in many people having rather negative experiences while applying for permits or licenses, attempting to renew licenses, registering vehicles, and more. Through this project, I hope to expedite the various processess of the VRL, make it easier for first time applicants to learn about licensing procedures, and introduce accessible features that assist thsoe who are not as technologically literate.

### Design statement: 
People find it difficult and confusing to navigate the current website for the Vehicle Registration & Licensing (VRL) department of the County of Hawai'i, preventing them from learning about the processes involved in VRL-related activities and making appointments accordingly.

### Competitor analysis:
I conducted a heuristic evaluation on the County of Hawai'i website (along with the Hawaii State Department of Health) to identify the most pressing obstacles users currently face when using the site. By evaluating the issues I notice against the ten heuristics, I more accurately pinpointed the exact problems that were plaguing the website and began proposing potential changes that would help improve the overall user experience.

The top 3 issues were the following:

| Heuristic | Usability Problem | Task Scenario |
|---|---|---|
| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors | When choosing a date for a Road Test Appointment, the user is not notified when the next available date and time is. | Find the earliest date for a road test appointment. |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | The lack of paragraph breaks throughout the information-dense pages makes finding certain requirements/documents difficult. | Identify the documents and procedures necessary to renew a license. |
| Help and Documentation | The FAQ section for the Department of Vehicle Registration & Licensing is obscured and not discoverable through the search function. | Find the FAQ section and check if a fax copy of an insurance card will suffice for a VRL office visit. |

### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
After conducting the initial heuristic evaluation, I decided that I needed to conduct a usability test (UT) so I could better evaluate the current website using the three metrics of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. By giving participants tasks and observing their behavior and thoughts as they work through them, UT allowed me to better empathize with typical users of the site––a first-time permit applicant who is unfamiliar with a lot of the jargon used on the site or an elderly who might not be techinologically literate. Frustrations of the user are highlighted and are used to point out areas of improvement for the next iteration of design. 

I asked my participant to perform three tasks that corresponded to the top three heuristics violated:
1. Find the earliest date for a road test appointment.
2. Identify the documents and procedures necessary to renew a license.
3. Find the FAQ section and check if a fax copy of an insurance card will suffice for a VRL office visit.

In regards to the County of Hawai’i website, the participant reaffirmed the usability problems I initially noticed through the heuristic evaluation. Overall, the test user was overwhelmed by the vast amount of information and had trouble finding buttons and reaching pages because there was too much text to sift through. For instance, the test user was not able to complete the first task, as all the dates and locations he checked for a road test appointment were fully booked. There was no system that suggested the next available date for the user. On the other hand, for the second and third tasks, the participant was able to complete them, though they took a longer time than I had anticipated.

Contextual inquiry differs from UT in that the instructions given to the test user are less specific and are meant to see how they would interact with the product in a natural setting. Like its name suggests, this process aims to give me, the researcher, more context about a typical user by allowing the participant talk about their motives behind using the VRL website, their hesitations, struggles, and what they like/dislike about the site.

My main takeaways were the following:
1. The availability of DMV appointments affects people’s desire to apply for a permit/license.
2. Jargon confuses potential applicants.
3. People are unfamiliar with the process of getting a license.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
UX storytelling is the key to empathizing and understanding the user. Storytelling essentially places the designer in the user’s shoes, allowing them to imagine problems the user faces and visualize how the user may respond to them. This allows them to design product features that more directly resolve the pain points of the user. Most importantly, UX storytelling helps the designer get rid of any biases they might have had and design in a human-centered manner.

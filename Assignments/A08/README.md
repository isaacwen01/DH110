# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 8: Draft Documentation
Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021


### Introduction: 
This project aims to examine the accessibility and efficiency of Hawaiian government websites. Our government plays an important role in society, from taking actions on social issues to protecting our boundaries. Of course, our government also manages the way we go about our daily lives, including setting regulations on transportation and healthcare. Hawaii, for instance, has around 516,544 registered automobiles––all of these drivers have had to interact with the DMV at one point. Healthcare, on the other hand, is even more of a necessity, and for Hawaii's 1.4 million population, access to the right health resources and information is beyond crucial. For this reason, I specifically wanted to analyze the website for Vehicle Registration & Licensing and Hawaii State Department of Health to examine ways we could expedite the licensing process and make health-related news/resources more accessible for everyone.


### Design statement: 
People find it difficult and confusing to navigate the current website for the Vehicle Registration & Licensing (VRL) department of the County of Hawai'i, preventing them from learning about the processes involved in VRL-related activities and making appointments accordingly.

### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
I conducted a heuristic evaluation on the current County of Hawai'i website. This website belongs to the County of Hawaii and offers tax services, employment information, tax maps, permits, etc. However, I’ll mainly be examining the Vehicle Registration and Licensing Division. The webpage covers information about VRL Office Appointments, Road Test Appointments, COVID-19 FAQs, and many other forms and documents that are crucial for vehicle registration and licensing.

### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) Explained
| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | The system informs the user about what is going on. It indicates the status of the task and gives appropriate feedback. |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | The system is intuitive and designed based on ideas and concepts familiar or logical to the user. |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | The system allows the user to have control and use the site freely, including the ability to undo and redo. |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | The system follows conventions in its design and makes sure its components are designed consistently across the platform. |
| 5 | Error Prevention | The system prevents error-prone conditions and offers safety-nets such as reminders or a confirmation notice. |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | The system gives options to choose from or suggestions to reference. |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | The system is designed flexibly so that there are multiple ways for the user to perform a task. |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | The system contains only relevant information and its design components present the information in an uncluttered, useful way. |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | The system informs the user of errors and provides suggestions to resolve the issue. |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | The system has additional resources to help users complete their tasks. |

### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group
Ratings are displayed in parentheses after each usability issue.
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
The purpose of a usability test (UT) is to evaluate a website using the three metrics of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. It is a relatively reliable way to identify and gauge how severe specific usability problems are. By giving participants tasks and observing their behavior and thoughts as they work through them, UT allows designers to better empathize with a typical user of the product. Frustrations of the user are highlighted and are used to point out areas of improvement for the next iteration of design.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
UX storytelling is the key to empathizing and understanding the user. Storytelling essentially places the designer in the user’s shoes, allowing them to imagine problems the user faces and visualize how the user may respond to them. This allows them to design product features that more directly resolve the pain points of the user. Most importantly, UX storytelling helps the designer get rid of any biases they might have had and design in a human-centered manner.

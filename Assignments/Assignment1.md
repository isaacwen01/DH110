# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021

### About the project:
This project aims to examine the accessibility and efficiency of Hawaiian government websites. Our government plays an important role in society, 
from taking actions on social issues to protecting our boundaries. Of course, our government also manages the way we go about our daily lives, 
including setting regulations on transportation and healthcare. Hawaii, for instance, has around 516,544 registered automobiles––all of these drivers
have had to interact with the DMV at one point. Healthcare, on the other hand, is even more of a necessity and for Hawaii's 1.4 million population, 
access to the right health resources and information is beyond crucial. For this reason, I specifically wanted to analyze the website for Vehicle 
Registration & Licencing and Hawaii State Department of Health to examine ways we could expedite the licencing process and make health-related 
news/resources more accessible for everyone.

### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) Explained
| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | The system informs the user about what is going on. It indicates the status of the task and gives appropriate feedback. |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | The system is intuitive and designed based on ideas and concepts familiar or logical to the user. |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | The system allows the user to have control and use the site freely, including the ability to undo and redo. |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | The system follows conventions in its design and makes sure its components are designed consistently across the platform. |
| 5 | Error Prevention | The system prevents error-prone conditions and offers safety-nets such as reminders or a confirmation notice. |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | The system gives options to choose from or suggestions to reference. |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | The system is designed flexibly so that there are multiple ways for a user to perform a task. |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | The system contains only relevant information and its design components present the information in an uncluttered, useful way. |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | The system informs the users of errors and provides suggestions to resolve the issue. |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | The system has additional resources to help users complete their tasks. |

### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group
Ratings are displayed in parentheses after each usability issue.
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

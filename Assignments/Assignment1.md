# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021

### About the project:
This project aims to examine the accessibility and efficiency of Hawaiian government websites. Our government plays an important role in society, 
from taking actions on social issues to protecting our boundaries. Of course, our government also manages the way we go about our daily lives, 
including setting regulations on transportation and healthcare. Hawaii, for instance, has around 516,544 registered automobiles––all of these drivers
have had to interact with the DMV at one point. Healthcare, on the other hand, is even more of a necessity and for Hawaii's 1.4 million population, 
access to the right health resources and information is beyond crucial. For this reason, I specifically wanted to analyze the website for Vehicle 
Registration & Licensing and Hawaii State Department of Health to examine ways we could expedite the licensing process and make health-related 
news/resources more accessible for everyone.

### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) Explained
| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | The system informs the user about what is going on. It indicates the status of the task and gives appropriate feedback. |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | The system is intuitive and designed based on ideas and concepts familiar or logical to the user. |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | The system allows the user to have control and use the site freely, including the ability to undo and redo. |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | The system follows conventions in its design and makes sure its components are designed consistently across the platform. |
| 5 | Error Prevention | The system prevents error-prone conditions and offers safety-nets such as reminders or a confirmation notice. |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | The system gives options to choose from or suggestions to reference. |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | The system is designed flexibly so that there are multiple ways for the user to perform a task. |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | The system contains only relevant information and its design components present the information in an uncluttered, useful way. |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | The system informs the user of errors and provides suggestions to resolve the issue. |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | The system has additional resources to help users complete their tasks. |

### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group
Ratings are displayed in parentheses after each usability issue.
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |



## Website 1: [Vehicle Registration & Licensing](https://www.hawaiicounty.gov/departments/finance/vehicle-registration-licensing)

### About
This website belongs to the County of Hawaii and offers tax services, employment information, tax maps, permits, etc. However, I’ll mainly be examining the Vehicle Registration and Licensing Division. The webpage covers information about VRL Office Appointments, Road Test Appointments, COVID-19 FAQs, and many other forms and documents that are crucial for vehicle registration and licensing.

### Initial Overall Evaluation
Overall, I’d say the website is very informative and detailed. It’s updated to include protocols for COVID-19. It colors important phrases, dates of updates, and useful links in red. On the page for VRL Office Appointments or Road Test Appointments, the procedures and requirements for making appointments are extremely detailed and thorough. However, the overall lack of buttons and visuals makes the information-dense web pages hard to read through. Furthermore, each page lacks an intentional layout––the text is structured into paragraph format without many breaks. This layout is uneasy on the eye and discourages the user from reading each page thoroughly.

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* **Good**: The website highlights the sidebar item of the page the user is currently on. When booking a VRL Office Appointment, there are tabs in the center of the page to indicate which of the 3 stages––Choose Appointment, Your Info, and Confirmation––the user is in.
*  **Bad**: When scheduling a Road Test appointment, there is no clear indication as to which stage of the process the user is in. This makes it difficult for the user to gauge how much longer the scheduling process will take. (2)
> *Recommendation: Add a status bar to help the user recognize how far into the appointment-making process they are. The status bar could be split into four sections: “Schedule an Appointment,” “Your Info,” “Confirmation,” and “Make payment”.*

#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* **Good**: The sidebar items under the DMV website are organized in a logical manner. More complex items like “Driver Licensing––General Information” are broken down into subitems.
*  **Bad**: However, some subitems can be a little intimidating and confusing for people who are unfamiliar with driving jargon, including people who are first-time drivers looking to apply for a permit or license. Terms like “Limited Purpose Instruction Permit” or even “Provisional Drivers License” may confuse users. (2)
> *Recommendation: Rename and group sidebar items to more general terms such as “Types of Permits & License” so that the users feel more comfortable navigating the website. After clicking into the renamed menu item, terms that may seem unfamiliar to first-time drivers should be explained and then added as dropdown menu items.*

# Accessiblity of Hawaiian Government Websites

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Isaac Wen | DH 110 | Fall 2021

### About the project:
This project aims to examine the accessibility and efficiency of Hawaiian government websites. Our government plays an important role in society, 
from taking actions on social issues to protecting our boundaries. Of course, our government also manages the way we go about our daily lives, 
including setting regulations on transportation and healthcare. Hawaii, for instance, has around 516,544 registered automobiles––all of these drivers
have had to interact with the DMV at one point. Healthcare, on the other hand, is even more of a necessity and for Hawaii's 1.4 million population, 
access to the right health resources and information is beyond crucial. For this reason, I specifically wanted to analyze the website for Vehicle 
Registration & Licencing and Hawaii State Department of Health to examine ways we could expedite the licencing process and make health-related 
news/resources more accessible for everyone.
